#Pongutile

A little test using Unity + Futile. This is my first project with Unity and Futile. The code is based on Matt Rix's BananaDemo

##How to try the demo project##

####How to open the project

- Grab the project from github and put it somewhere - [For the lazy, here's a zip of the whole repo](https://github.com/luisparravicini/Pongutile/zipball/master)
- Make sure you have Unity installed
- Go into PongutileDemoProject/Assets/Scenes and open PongutileDemoScene.unity

####How to make sure you're running it at the right resolution
- Go to File -> Build Settings -> Click "PC and Mac Standalone" -> Click "Switch Platform" (if it's already greyed out, you're good)
- On the Build Settings page, choose Player Settings
- Under Resolution and Presentation, set the size to 960x640
- Go to the "Game" tab 
- In the top left dropdown, choose your resolution (instead of "Free aspect")
- In the top right, make sure "Maximize on Play" is enabled.

Notes: 
- If you choose a specific resolution, but the game window isn't large enough to contain that resolution, it'll open in some random scaled resolution, and everything will be wonky, which is annoying. 
- If you're on OSX and you own iOS Basic or Pro, you can choose iOS instead of standalone

####The code and art assets (except for the font) can be used for anything
####The font is [Imagine](http://www.dafont.com/es/imagine-font.font)
